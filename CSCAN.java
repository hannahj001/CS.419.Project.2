/**
 * This class will implement the C-SCAN
 * disk scheduling algorithm.
 *FROM TEXTBOOK
 *
 * Circular SCAN (C-SCAN ) scheduling is a variant of SCAN designed to provide
 * a more uniform wait time. Like SCAN, C-SCAN moves the head from one end of
 * the disk to the other, servicing requests along the way. When the head reaches
 * the other end, however, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk
 * without servicing any requests on the return trip.
 * Letâ€™s return to our example to illustrate. Before applying C-SCAN to schedule
 * the requests on cylinders 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, and 67, we need to
 * know the direction of head movement in which the requests are scheduled.
 * Assuming that the requests are scheduled when the disk arm is moving from
 * 0 to 199 and that the initial head position is again 53, the request will be served
 * as depicted in Figure 11.8. The C-SCAN scheduling algorithm essentially treats
 * the cylinders as a circular list that wraps around from the final cylinder to the
 * first one.
